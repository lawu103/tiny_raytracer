# tiny_raytracer

An early test with raytracing that I did according to https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer.

As it turns out, I ended up making a much better one as part of my introductory computer graphics courses, but academic integrity policies don't allow me to publicly post the code I submitted as part of that project. But I should get around to making some sort of write-up for that...
